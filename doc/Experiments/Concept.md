## Technical Implementation

Events are generated by the `SocketGenerator`.
The `SocketGenerator` is controlled by a manager running in the same JVM as the `SocketGenerator`.
It observes the zookeeper store, and controls how many events the socket generator produces

The socketReceiver is a simple Flink Source, that reads data from the socket and exposes the data as elements.




## Questions

- Does it matter that his socketReceiver cannot be restored on some offset (Otherwise it would need all uncommitted data as its checkpointed state)?
